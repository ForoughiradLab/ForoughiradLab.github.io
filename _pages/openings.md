**Graduate students:** the Foroughirad Lab can recruit graduate students through the [Marine Biology](https://www.tamug.edu/marb/degrees/Marine_Biology_graduate_program.html) department at [Texas A&M University at Galveston](https://www.tamug.edu/).

If you are interested in joining the lab, I recommend reaching out to me at <vforough@tamug.edu> around 2 to 5 months before the application deadline with the following materials: 

1. CV
2. Unofficial academic transcript
3. One-page summary of your research interests and experience
4. Optional â€“ writing sample (publication, honors or masters thesis, etc.)

**Postdocs:** I do not have funding for postdocs at the moment, but am happy to discuss collaborations on fellowship applications.

**Undergraduate students:** I accept new undergraduate students at the beginning of each semester, pending space. I recommend reaching out to me about 2 weeks before the start of classes for information on how to apply. 

<!--**Field assistants:** Openings for summer 2024 field assistant positions are posted! Apply here [NSF ETAP](https://etap.nsf.gov/award/135/opportunity/7560) by February 15th.-->
