### Vivienne Foroughirad - *Principal Investigator*
<br>
Vivienne is a behavioral ecologist interested in the fitness consequences of the social environment. Her research integrates genetics and long-term studies to characterize the evolutionary processes shaping patterns of variation in social structure across cetacean species. Vivienne earned her Ph.D. with Andy Read at the Duke University Marine Lab and then did a postdoc with Janet Mann at Georgetown University before moving to Galveston. <!--[CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzf3civc9w92tvp/NancyCVApril2019.pdf?dl=0)-->

### Nikki Shintaku - *PhD Student*
<br>
Nikki is a PhD student in the Marine Biology program at Texas A&M University at Galveston. Her research interests include population genomics/genetics and behavioral ecology in bottlenose dolphins and how they inform marine conservation actions. She received a Master's of Coastal Environmental Management from Duke University and a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from University of California, Davis. Go Aggies!

### Ashley Rogers - *Masters Student*
<br>
Ashley is a Masters student in the Marine Biology program at Texas A&M University at Galveston. Her research interests include social learning and foraging ecology in bottlenose dolphins and how they inform conservation and management strategies of the species. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Ecology, Evolution and Organismal Biology from Vanderbilt University.

### Zoe Olson - *Undergraduate Technician*
<br>
Zoe is an undergraduate Marine Biology major and Dive Technologies and Methods minor from Texas A&M University at Galveston. She is interested in researching cetacean behavioral and acoustic ecology on odontocetes such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins. She also takes part in photography, which she hope will be useful in the Foroughirad lab and in my future research. Besides being a lab technician, she am also a member of Sea Aggie Dolphin Investigative Program, in which she photographs and collect behavioral data of the bottlenose dolphin population near Texas A&M Galveston.

### Camari Knox - *Undergraduate Technician*
<br>
Camari is an undergraduate student with the Marine Science department at Texas A&M University at Galveston, with plans of pursuing a PhD. She aims to pursue a career focused in behavioral ecology of beluga whales, particularly their use of echolocation in the Arctic. She also plans to join ocean conservation efforts.

### Madison Ealey - *Undergraduate Technician*
<br>
Madison is a senior pursuing a bachelor’s degree in marine biology at Texas A&M University at Galveston. She has plans to advance to a master’s program, she is eager to engage in first-hand research focusing on the physiology and morphology of cetaceans, particularly of sperm whales. Madison’s  academic journey is driven by a deep-seated passion for marine life and a commitment to contributing valuable insights to the field.

### Elizabeth Flesch - *Postdoctoral Scholar (co-advised by Jay Rotella)*

Elizabeth is interested in understanding how external forces influence population genetics across landscapes.  She is using demographic and genomic methods to evaluate the spatial scale of dispersal and gene flow among breeding colonies of Weddell seals found in Antarctica.  This approach will help identify potential drivers of temporal variation in immigration.  Elizabeth earned her Ph.D. at Montana State University, where her dissertation addressed the population genomics of bighorn sheep in the Rocky Mountains.  In her free time, she enjoys rock climbing, gardening, and hiking.
