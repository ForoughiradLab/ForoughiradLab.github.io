### Vivienne Foroughirad - *Principal Investigator*

Vivienne is a behavioral ecologist interested in the fitness consequences of the social environment. Her research integrates genetics and long-term studies to characterize the evolutionary processes shaping patterns of variation across cetacean species. Vivienne earned her Ph.D. with Andy Read at the Duke University Marine Lab and then did a postdoc with Janet Mann at Georgetown University before moving to Galveston. She is committed to promoting equity and inclusion in STEM. Outside of the lab Vivienne enjoys photography, birdwatching, and . <!--[CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzf3civc9w92tvp/NancyCVApril2019.pdf?dl=0)-->

### Elizabeth Flesch - *Postdoctoral Scholar (co-advised by Jay Rotella)*

Elizabeth is interested in understanding how external forces influence population genetics across landscapes.  She is using demographic and genomic methods to evaluate the spatial scale of dispersal and gene flow among breeding colonies of Weddell seals found in Antarctica.  This approach will help identify potential drivers of temporal variation in immigration.  Elizabeth earned her Ph.D. at Montana State University, where her dissertation addressed the population genomics of bighorn sheep in the Rocky Mountains.  In her free time, she enjoys rock climbing, gardening, and hiking.
