### Vivienne Foroughirad - *Principal Investigator*
<br>
Vivienne is a behavioral ecologist interested in the fitness consequences of the social environment. Her research integrates genetics and long-term studies to characterize the evolutionary processes shaping patterns of variation in social structure across cetacean species. Vivienne earned her Ph.D. with Andy Read at the Duke University Marine Lab and then did a postdoc with Janet Mann at Georgetown University before moving to Galveston. <!--[CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzf3civc9w92tvp/NancyCVApril2019.pdf?dl=0)-->

### Nikki Shintaku - *PhD Student*
<br>
Nikki is a PhD student in the Marine Biology program at Texas A&M University at Galveston. Her research interests include population genomics/genetics and behavioral ecology in bottlenose dolphins and how they inform marine conservation actions. She received a Master's of Coastal Environmental Management from Duke University and a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from University of California, Davis. Go Aggies!

### Ava Reynolds - *Undergraduate Technician*
<br>
Ava is a sophomore Marine Biology student at Texas A&M University at Galveston. Her interests include marine mammal ecology and behavior. After completing her Bachelor's degree, she plans to complete her Master's degree.

### Zoe Olson - *Undergraduate Technician*
<br>
Zoe is an undergraduate Marine Biology major and Dive Technologies and Methods minor from Texas A&M University at Galveston. She is interested in researching cetacean behavioral and acoustic ecology on odontocetes such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins. She also takes part in photography, which she hope will be useful in the Foroughirad lab and in my future research. Besides being a lab technician, she am also a member of Sea Aggie Dolphin Investigative Program, in which she photographs and collect behavioral data of the bottlenose dolphin population near Texas A&M Galveston.

### Julianna Rosales - *Undergraduate Technician*
<br>
My name is Julianna and I'm an undergraduate junior at Texas A&M University at Galveston. My interests focus on marine ecology and animal behaviors. I also volunteer in the invertebrate lab on campus. In my free time I like to crochet!

### Elizabeth Flesch - *Postdoctoral Scholar (co-advised by Jay Rotella)*

Elizabeth is interested in understanding how external forces influence population genetics across landscapes.  She is using demographic and genomic methods to evaluate the spatial scale of dispersal and gene flow among breeding colonies of Weddell seals found in Antarctica.  This approach will help identify potential drivers of temporal variation in immigration.  Elizabeth earned her Ph.D. at Montana State University, where her dissertation addressed the population genomics of bighorn sheep in the Rocky Mountains.  In her free time, she enjoys rock climbing, gardening, and hiking.
